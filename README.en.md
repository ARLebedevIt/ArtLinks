# About

### A small project with links to my hobbies. Written based on examples from the React Three Fiber / Drei documentation.  
Initially, the project used the @react-three/postprocessing library, Bloom, Viniette, DepthOfField and other delights, but as a result I got 30-40 frames on PC and 20 frames on Mac.  
Therefore, the final version looks somewhat more modest than the original.

P.S. In each project, my creative vision is ahead of the available technological resource, so I have to "shrink".  
Indeed, to make a beautiful and workable "thing" is also an art.  

P.S.S. Fog and item locations are randomly generated as the page is refreshed, so you'll see a different environment every time.
